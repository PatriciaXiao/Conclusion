Efficiency is merely a descriptive term and does not carry with it the theoretical baggage of "parallel", "serial" and so forth.

As the difference shrinks, the slope of the RT x set size function rises. Nagy and Sanchez (1990) identified the smallest color difference that supported efficient search. This can be thought of as a preattentive just noticable difference (preattentive JND)
they found that smaller color differences would support efficient search
D'Zmura has proposed that efficient search is possible whenever the target and distractor colors lie on different sides of a line drawn through color space. This is illustrated in Figure Seven.

Treisman's argument is that it is easier to find the
deviation from red than to find red among deviants. Another way to describe the result is to say that targets are easy to find if and only if
they contain some unique basic feature information. Magenta contains "blue" and can be found by looking for blue among distractors that
are not blue. Red contains red, but so does magenta. This search is less efficient because is relatively more difficult to look for "reddest" or
"not blue". In this account, preattentive color space is divided into a few regions, a few basic colors. Indeed, many of the results with large
color differences can be simulated in a model that assumes four basic colors in preattentive processing: red, yellow, green, and blue (Wolfe,
1994). The apparently categorical description of large color differences and the linear separablity account of search with smaller
differences remain to be reconciled in a single description of the preattentive representation of color.

Specifically, the systematic work on color search has been done in two dimensions of color space. It needs to be extended into the third, luminance dimension.
